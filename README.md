# E-Commerce_data
This dataset contains comprehensive information about E-commerce sales. The columns include 'InvoiceNo,' 'StockCode,' 'Description,' 'InvoiceDate,' 'CustomerID,' 'Country,' 'Quantity,' and 'UnitPrice.'
I have conducted various analyses on this dataset, ranging from descriptive statistics to visualizing key performance indicators (KPIs).
For detailed insights and visualization plots, please refer to the notebook file.
The analyses provide valuable insights into sales patterns, customer behavior, popular products, top-performing countries, and other important aspects of the E-commerce business.
The notebook file presents a comprehensive overview of the data exploration and analysis, enabling a deeper understanding of the E-commerce sales dataset.
